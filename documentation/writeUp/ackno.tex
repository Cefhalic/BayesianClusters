\textbf{Acknowledgments}

I'd like to thank Dr Andrew Rose for his guidance throughout this project, without which this project would not have been possible. Secondly, I'd to thank MiQi Lim for her help in deciphering all the biological aspects of this project. Finally, I'd like to thank Tim Heightman, for his keen eyes proofreading this project, and for getting me through this master's degree.\\

\textbf{Declaration}
I declare that the work presented in this thesis was entirely written by me, and will not be used for other academic purposes. Any materials protocols, algorithms and previously written code have been correctly cited. The bulk of the implementation was undertaken by Dr Andrew Rose before the beginning of this project, namely the identification of useful algorithmic speed-ups, the conversion of raw data into equivalent, lightweight forms, and the introduction of multi-threading. The contribution of this report is the verification of the function of the software, both through debugging and analysing SMLM data using this procedure. 
The contents of this report are entirely my own.
